The project was developed in two repositories: [bucket-webapp](https://github.com/972C8/bucket-webapp) and [bucket-frontend](https://github.com/mahgoh/bucket-frontend). `bucket-webapp` contains the main application and the final web application. The frontend was developed in the repository `bucket-frontend`, using a custom HTML bundler - more information about the bundler can be found in the repository.
